Build a blog demo (with Rails 3.1)
  pre_cursor

  overview (For each: do and inspect output)
    Make an app (create_new_app.txt)
      rails new blog
    Generate a Posts scaffold (generate_scaffold.txt)
      rails generate scaffold
    List the tasks a Rails app provides you (rake_tasks.txt)
      rake -T 
    Build the database (the_database.txt)
      rake db:create, rake db:migrate, database.yml

  run_the_app_and_dive_deep
    Your app is running...and worthless
      rails server

    Make it not worthless
      rm public/index.html

    Now its broken
      "No route matches [GET] "/""

    Edit config/routes.rb
      root :to => 'posts#index'
  
  dynamic inspection
    rake routes
    rake test
  
  look at the tests
    controller tests
    model tests
  
  TDD with one method
    the_method_that_returns_false
    add the test see the error
    add the method and see the test fail
    make the method return false and see the test pass
 
  rails console

  rails console --debugger
